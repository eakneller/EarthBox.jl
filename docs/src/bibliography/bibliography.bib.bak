  abstract = {The breakup of a supercontinent is a vital process of global tectonic evolution. How exactly West Gondwana and Pangea broke up is a controversial topic with many unanswered questions and problems that the reconstruction models attempt to solve. Since the mid-20th century in the course of modeling the South Atlantic tectonic evolution, several works contributed to the understanding of South America and Africa pre-breakup configuration, early stages of rift, and the kinematic involved in the rupture. However, these plate reconstruction models present several misfit problems. Here we review and analyze such misfits based on compiled geophysical and geological data by reproducing and comparing 15 reconstruction models since the pioneering work of Bullard et al. (1965). The location and magnitude of gaps and overlaps in each model are significantly different, in which fit differences mostly result from the assumed deformation. Nevertheless, a few similarities can be drawn, such as the maximum implemented overlap in the Central segment of the South Atlantic. We recognize that the accurate quantification of intraplate deformation is a challenge in refined models, and argue that South Atlantic models that restore intraplate deformation using geological and kinematic constraints tend to achieve a better fit.},

  abstract = {Slow and ultraslow spreading oceanic crust consists of a heterogenous mixture of serpentinised mantle and magmatic rocks. In these environments, both crustal architecture and faulting mode have been attributed to the interplay between magmatism and tectonics. Numerical models have investigated how variations in melt supply influence tectonics. However, how tectonics influences melt production and the formation of a heterogeneous crust is not well understood. Here, we use 2D numerical models to analyze how coupled tectonics, mantle melting, melt emplacement and serpentinization interact. Our model shows that ocean loading and crustal density promote fault offsets and durations. We focus on ultraslow, magma-poor ridges, in particular the Southwest Indian Ridge at 64°30′ East, which exhibits crustal thickening along detachment faults interpreted as a deep serpentinization front. We reproduce the observed bathymetry, seafloor morphology, shaped by alternating flip-flop detachments, and crustal thickness variations, ∼3–6 km, associated with deep along-fault serpentinisation. We find that in this magma-poor environment, where serpentinized mantle dominates crustal composition and magmatic effects on tectonics are limited, variations in melt production are the consequence of changes in mantle flow patterns in response to faulting. Early detachment evolution leads to a slow-down in mantle upwelling and melt production decrease. Late in the detachment life-cycle, antithetic faults in its footwall trigger enhanced mantle upwelling, increasing melt production. During the flip-flop detachment life-cycle, tectonically induced spatio-temporal variations in magma emplacement and serpentinisation contribute to the formation of a heterogeneous crustal architecture and magnetic signature of the seafloor.},

  abstract = {Abstract Erosion and deposition redistribute mass as a continental rift evolves, which modifies crustal loads and influences subsequent deformation. Surface processes therefore impact both the architecture and the evolution of passive margins. Here we use coupled numerical models to explore the interactions between the surface, crust, and lithosphere. This interaction is primarily sensitive to the efficiency of the surface processes in transporting mass from source to sink. If transport is efficient, there are two possible outcomes: (1) Faulting within the zone of extension is longer lived and has larger offsets. This implies a reduction of the number of faults and the width of the proximal domain. (2) Efficient transport of sediment leads to significant deposition and hence thermal blanketing. This will induce a switch from brittle to ductile deformation of the upper crust in the distal domains. The feedbacks between these two outcomes depend on the extension history, the underlying lithospheric rheology, and the influence of submarine deposition on sediment transport. High erosion/sedimentation during early faulting leads to abrupt crustal necking, while intermediate syntectonic sedimentation rates over distal deep submarine hotter crust leads to unstructured wide distal domains. In models where rheological conditions favor the formation of asymmetric conjugate margins, only subaerial transport of sediments into the distal domains can increase conjugate symmetry by plastic localization. These models suggest that passive margin architecture can be strongly shaped by the solid Earth structure, sea level, and climatic conditions during breakup.},

Critically important thermodynamic properties include density, heat capacity, volatile solubility, enthalpy, entropy, and volume of fusion, liquidus temperatures and the variations of all properties with temperature, pressure, and composition. Magma transport is governed by conservation of energy, momentum, and mass that depends on thermal conductivity, shear viscosity, and diffusivity (tracer, chemical and isotopic), and varies with temperature, pressure, composition, phase proportions, and shear rates in complex and interwoven ways. In this chapter magma properties are reviewed in the context of petrogenesis and transport phenomena together with underlying theory. Results are presented both graphically and in tabular form providing a survey across the dominant compositions and conditions relevant to igneous petrology.},

  abstract = {The compressibility of basic melt at 1 atmosphere is about an order of magnitude higher than that of mantle minerals. Consequently, the density contrast between melt and the principal residual crystals in mantle source regions is expected to decrease with increasing source region depth. The increasingly olivine-normative character of primary melts produced at greater depths is also expected to result in a decrease in this density contrast with increasing source region depth. Once vertical permeability is established by melt generated during partial melting, buoyancy-driven melt percolation can under some circumstances segregate melt from the residual crystals in its source region on a geologically rapid time scale. Limits to this process are provided by cooling of the source region (freezing melt in) and rigidity of the crystalline matrix (mechanically trapping melt). Source region size influences these limits strongly: consequently, small, partially molten diapirs (∼km in diameter) may be able to trap large melt fractions (≳30\%), but larger source regions would be unable to do so. The reduction in density contrast with pressure reduces the buoyant force driving melt percolation and provides another limit to melt segregation. Diapirs at depth may thus stably contain large fractions of melt but may decompress and unload their melt during ascent; this effect would be enhanced in small diapirs and may be relevant to the genesis of komatiitic magma. Melt compression may also be a factor in explaining why the very different maximum depths inferred for typical basic melt segregation from source regions on different planets—∼500 km on the moon, ∼250 km on Mars, ∼100 km on earth—correspond to similar pressures (25–35 kbar); at greater pressures, melt may no longer be capable under ordinary conditions of segregating upwards by buoyancy. This may also help to explain why depleted peridotites overlie more fertile peridotites and how deep regions of the mantle are able to remain fertile over geologic time.},

  abstract = {The choice of crustal and mantle densities in numerical geodynamic models is usually based on convention. The isostatic component of the topography is not calibrated to fit observations resulting in not very well constrained elevations. The density distribution on Earth is not easy to constrain because it involves multiple variables (temperature, pressure, composition, and deformation). We aim in this study to provide a reference case for geodynamic modelling where crustal and mantle densities are calibrated to fit the relative continent/mid-ocean ridge elevation in agreement with observations. We first review observed Earth topography of stable continents and of active mid-ocean ridges and define the characteristic average elevation of these domains. We use self-consistent thermodynamic calculations of dry mantle rocks that include partial melting to calibrate densities of the continental lithospheric mantle and beneath the mid-ocean ridge. The thermodynamic solutions are coupled with a 2-D incompressible plane strain finite element method for viscous-plastic creeping flows to solve for the dynamic evolution during extension from continental rifting to mid-ocean spreading. The combined results from 2-D thermo-mechanical models and 1-D isostatic calculations show that the relative elevation difference between mid-ocean ridges and continents depends on crustal density, mantle composition, and the degree of depletion of the lithospheric mantle. Based on these results we calibrate the reference density that only depends on temperature, which can be used in classic thermo-mechanical models based on the Boussinesq approximation. Finally the model calibration provides a solution that fits (1) the elevation of active mid-ocean ridges far from hotspots (-2750±250 m), (2) the elevation of stable continents far from hotspots (+400±400 m), (3) the average depletion buoyancy of the continental lithospheric mantle (between -20 and -50±15 kg/m3 depending on lithospheric thickness) and (4) the average continental crust density (2835±35 kg/m3 for a 35 km thick crust).},

  abstract = {The North Sea is a major continental basin filled with early Paleozoic to Recent sediments. Though graben formation started in the Triassic, the last major period of extension occurred between the Middle Jurassic and the mid-Cretaceous. Following the faulting and graben formation associated with this extension, subsidence within the central North Sea was widespread and uniform and has created a saucershaped sedimentary basin. This was filled successively by chalks, sandstones, and finally, during most of the Tertiary, by shales and mudstones. We examined the subsidence of six wells down the middle and two on the flanks of the Central Graben. In the period of widespread steady subsidence the water-loaded basement depth in the middle increased by 1100–1400 m. On the flanks the basement subsided 600–700 m. We suggest that most of this subsidence results from the thermal relaxation of the lithosphere which was thinned during a Middle Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous stretching of the crust. Assuming a crustal stretching and associated lithospheric thinning of between 50 and 100\% in the middle and decreasing on either side, we obtained a good match to the observed amplitude and rate of subsidence. The Middle Jurassic to mid-Cretaceous subsidence which is found within the graben proper we relate to the fault-controlled initial subsidence which occurred during the actual stretching. The measured heat flow is compatible with such a stretching model. Though there is no seismic refraction data across the Central Graben, this model is strongly supported by evidence of a thinner crust under the Viking Graben to the north and the Witchground/Buchan Graben complex to the east. Using the above observations as the basis for a geological interpretation, we examined the thermal maturity and hydrocarbon potential of certain sedimentary horizons in the northern section of the Central Graben. In analyzing the various wells we extended previous work on the compaction correction to handle overpressuring and mixed lithologies in backstripping studies. Further, we expanded these methods to include the variation of thermal conductivity, and calculations of the degree of thermal maturation of the deposited sediments, through time.},

The parameterization is computationally efficient and can be modified easily as better experimental data become available.

  abstract = {Models of oceanic crustal accretion should be able to reproduce both petrological and geological observations from ophiolites and geophysical observations from active spreading ridges. We have developed thermal models of crustal accretion at fast spreading ridges that incorporate petrological variation and allow for a variable vertical distribution of crystallization. Including petrological variation has a major effect on the distribution of melt within the crust and the consequent interpretation of model results in terms of geophysical observables. In particular, the narrow melt lens imaged by seismic reflection surveys can be produced by the presence of large-scale compositional stratification within the crust, such as that observed in the Oman ophiolite. Controlling the vertical distribution of crystallization allows a range of crustal accretion mechanisms to be tested, including the many sills and gabbro glacier models. Both gabbro glacier and many sills models can broadly match the geophysical observations, but the preferred model is a hybrid, where the uppermost 25\% or more of the lower crust forms in a gabbro glacier and the lowermost 25\% or more of the lower crust forms by crystallization in situ. The success of all models is dependent on the strength and distribution of hydrothermal cooling.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that around the brittle-ductile transition, crustal faults can be significantly weaker than predicted by conventional two-mechanism brittle-ductile strength envelopes. Factors contributing to this weakness include the polyphase nature of natural rocks, foliation development, and the action of fluid-assisted processes such as pressure solution. Recently, ring shear experiments using halite/kaolinite mixtures as an analogue for phyllosilicate-rich rocks for the first time showed frictional-viscous behavior (i.e., both normal stress and strain rate sensitive behavior) involving the combined effects of pressure solution and phyllosilicates. This behavior was accompanied by the development of a mylonitic microstructure. A quantitative assessment of the implications of this for the strength of natural faults has hitherto been hampered by the absence of a microphysical model. In this paper, a microphysical model for shear deformation of foliated, phyllosilicate-bearing fault rock by pressure solution-accommodated sliding along phyllosilicate foliae is developed. The model predicts purely frictional behavior at low and high shear strain rates and frictional-viscous behavior at intermediate shear strain rates. The mechanical data on wet halite + kaolinite gouge compare favorably with the model. When applied to crustal materials, the model predicts major weakening with respect to conventional brittle-ductile strength envelopes, in particular, around the brittle-ductile transition. The predicted strength profiles suggest that in numerical models of crustal deformation the strength of high-strain regions could be approximated by an apparent friction coefficient of 0.25–0.35 down to depths of 15–20 km.},

In this paper we will give a detailed description of this code. The temperature equation is advanced in time with the Lagrangian marker techniques based on the method of characteristics and the temperature solution is interpolated back to an Eulerian grid configuration at each timestep. This marker approach allows for the accurate portrayal of very fine thermal structures. For attaining a high relative accuracy in the solution of the matrix equations associated with both the momentum and temperature equations, we have employed the direct matrix inversion technique, which becomes feasible with the advent of very large shared-memory machines. Our conservative finite-difference schemes allow us to capture sharp variations of the stresses and thermal gradients in problems with a strongly variable viscosity and thermal conductivity. We have tested this code with numerous examples drawn from Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities, the descent of a stiff object into a medium with a lower viscosity, viscous heating and flows with non-Netwonian rheology. We have also benchmarked successfully with variable viscosity convection for lateral viscosity contrast up to 108. We have delineated the regions in thermal problems where the diffusive nature of the temperature equation changes from its parabolic character locally to a non-linear hyperbolic-like equation due to the presence of variable thermal conductivity. Finally we discuss the applicability of this marker-based and finite-difference technique to other evolutionary equations in geophysics.},

  abstract = {The most time consuming and computationally intensive steps in petroleum systems analysis involve building heat flow boundary conditions that are consistent with regional geologic observations, solving the transient heat equation, and translating a range of hydrocarbon charge predictions from source intervals into prospect specific predictions that can be used for decision making in oil and gas exploration. Furthermore, three-dimensional regional flexure, which can have a significant impact on paleo-migration pathways, often is not included in the critical step of translating charge calculations into trap specific predictions due to the time-consuming nature of map preparation. In this paper, an efficient and integrated petroleum systems analysis (IPA) workflow is presented with a new fast, semi-analytical, decoupled approach for solving the transient heat equation that is fully integrated with a rapid inversion methodology for transient heat flow boundary conditions and a 3D regional flexural reconstruction that uses standard basin modeling inputs and requires little to no additional map preparation. A charge-to-trap model is also described that translates hydrocarbon expulsion calculations with dynamic parameterized gas fractions that vary with transformation ratio into trap specific predictions using flexurally restored migration polygons. This fully integrated and efficient approach enables rapid interactive investigation of uncertainty space and fast probabilistic modeling that is ideal for evaluating hydrocarbon charge and commodity risk in data-sparse frontier basins. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated for assessing charge and commodity risk with a case study from the Colorado Basin, Argentina, whereby two alternative hydrocarbon accumulation hypotheses that postulate that traps are filled to structural spill with undersaturated oil are tested for reservoirs located in the upper Colorado Formation that are charged by postulated Aptian and Neocomian source rocks. This application indicates that it is unlikely that the tested traps are filled to structural spill with undersaturated oil, and how incorrect conclusions on hydrocarbon commodity may be reached if 3D regional flexure is not considered during petroleum systems analysis. Finally, it is also shown how this integrated and efficient approach can be implemented with low-cost computational platforms such as Python Anaconda or in spreadsheet programs that empower modelers to rapidly translate their ideas into benchmarked prototypes that can be immediately leveraged by the geoscience community (www.github.com/eakneller/ipatoolkit3D).},

  abstract      = {A new technique is described for the numerical investigation of the time‐dependent flow of an incompressible fluid, the boundary of which is partially confined and partially free. The full Navier‐Stokes equations are written in finite‐difference form, and the solution is accomplished by finite‐time‐step advancement. The primary dependent variables are the pressure and the velocity components. Also used is a set of marker particles which move with the fluid. The technique is called the marker and cell method. Some examples of the application of this method are presented. All non‐linear effects are completely included, and the transient aspects can be computed for as much elapsed time as desired.},

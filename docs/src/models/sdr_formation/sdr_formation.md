*Case0: Base case model of magmatic crust formation and subaerial lava flow during lithospheric extension with high melt damage. The melt damage factor is equal to 10 (High Melt Damage), the initial thermal anomaly in the asthenosphere ``\Delta T_m`` is 100 °C, the eruption interval (``\Delta t_{erupt}``) is 50 thousand years and the fraction of melt extruded at the surface (``f_{ext}``) ranges from 6% to 50% as the characteristic magmatic crust increases from 6km to 7.5km.*

# Lithospheric Extension with Viscous Softening

Lithospheric extension with viscous strain softening whereby the pre-exponential
terms of dislocation creep flow law are modified with strain to mimic the
effects of viscous softening. Boundary conditions, model geometry and rheology 
are similar to Brune et al. (2014).

# Marker Failure Properties Update Steps

[1] Update cohesion ``\sigma_{c,m}`` and friction angle ``\theta_m`` for each marker ``m`` using 
equation [eq:strain-weakening](@ref) with marker plastic strain ``\epsilon_m^{plastic}``, initial 
fraction angle ``\theta_m^o`` final fraction angle ``\theta_m^f`` as described in 
[eq:final-friction-angle](@ref).

[2] Update Update cohesion ``\sigma_{c,m}`` and friction angle ``\theta_m`` for melt damage using 
equations [eq:melt-damage-weakening](@ref).
